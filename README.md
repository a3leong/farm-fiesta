# Setup instructions
Get word list at [this link](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/files/3120293/clean_words_alpha_revb.txt)  
and place it at `<root>/assets/dictionary/word_list.txt`  
I'm not sure what the usage rights are here so until I can generate a safe to use word list I'm going to just reference this
